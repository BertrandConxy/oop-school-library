# OOP School Library

> In this repository, I implemented a tool to record what books are in an imaginary library and who borrows them. The app that you allows users to:
> - Add new students or teachers.
> - Add new books.
> - Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
> - And all of this is built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
